### Intro

This project was introduced because I hate rewriting my resume over and over.

I wanted something that was different than the rest of the applicants by cutting right to the chase.
If you want to see a sample of my code, check out my resume itself.
I'm using node because I'm comfortable with it.

### Getting Started
use ```npm run build``` to build assets - definitely necessary if running for the first time.
use ```npm start``` to start up the server

### Material UI/Icons
I used material Icons for use with the resume. - see googles material design
    ```<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">```

### Express file server
- I'm currently using express as a file server

### Roadmap
- investigate and add a template engine to edit the configuration.
    - possibly use React
    - add functionality to each section but use same basic layout - create reusable components from sections.
    - first page should be used for 'grabbing one's attention' subsequent pages should be for a more detailed approach.
- map out data and templates to be able to switch them out.
- Localization?

### Guidelines
- Keep design as simple as possible but provide basic structure, no need to be too fancy ( K.I.S.S. principle )
- Fail fast, fail often, just remember to commit and branch when trying out anything radical.
    - e.g. a new templating engine.
